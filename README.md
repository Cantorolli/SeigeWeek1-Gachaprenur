# SeigeWeek1-Gachaprenur
Yet another game for Hackclub, this time featuring a classic Gashapon Machine!

Gachaprenur is a gacha game where you make money by selling your toy gachas and keep rolling on the machine until you make thousands!

Features some basic mechanics plus new stuff I learned:
- Save and autoload function!
- Ability to reset Save
- 16 characters
- Gacha system with Legendary, Epic, Rare, Uncommon, and Common rarities

All code and art was made by yours truly, Cantorolli
